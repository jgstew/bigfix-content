This folder contains templates for use with the Fixlet Maker dashboard in the BigFix Console.

These templates are fairly specific to the Fixlet Maker dashboard. To see examples that use the more generic Mustache template language, as well as a python module for automating them, see here: https://github.com/jgstew/generate_bes_from_template/tree/master/examples
